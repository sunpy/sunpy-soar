**********************************
Tables supported in ``sunpy-soar``
**********************************

The ``sunpy-soar`` library currently supports data retrieval from both science and low-latency data tables, such as ``v_sc_data_item`` and ``v_ll_data_item``.
Additionally, it provides support for join tables associated with remote instruments, such as ``v_eui_sc_fits``.

In the context of ``sunpy-soar``, data tables contain columns related to scientific measurements, while instrument tables contain metadata specific to particular instruments.
The ``sunpy-soar`` library specifically supports the wavelength and detector columns within these tables.
These columns are linked to the data columns in the instrument tables through a join operation, using the ``data_item_oid`` as the key.

How can a new column be added?
==============================

If the new column you wish to add is part of an existing data or instrument FITS table, you can extend the corresponding ADQL query to include this column.
For example, if the new column is in the instrument table, it should be included in the "SELECT" clause of the query for that table.

Moreover, if one needs to enable filtering by this new column, you must consider adding it as an attribute in the ``attrs.py`` file.
If the column already exists within `sunpy.net.attrs`, you should add a corresponding walker in the ``attrs.py`` file.
The ``_can_handle_query`` method in the ``client.py`` file should also be updated to ensure proper support for this new column in queries.

How can a new table be added?
=============================

When adding support for a new table in ``sunpy-soar``, it is essential to fully understand the context and requirements.
This includes identifying the key that will be used for join operations and determining what columns should be returned to the user.

For direct joins, the key relationship between the tables should be carefully identified.
Once the joins are established, the necessary columns can be included in the query, following the process outlined for adding columns.

Depending on the use case, you might need to determine the type of join (e.g., inner join, outer join, left join) and what specific tables or columns should be displayed to the user.

Finally, ensure that the ``_do_search`` method is updated to reflect these changes. 
This method should handle any additional columns or conditional logic for attribute-specific queries, ensuring that the appropriate columns is returned to the user.

Allowing an attribute to work in the search query
=================================================

For any attribute to work in the search query, we can divide the situation in two cases:

case 1: It is already there in `sunpy.net.attrs`, in this situation just a walker needs to be created.

Example on its implementation: 

.. code-block:: python

    # Adding a walker applier for that attribute.
    @walker.add_applier(a.AttrName)
    def _(wlk, attr, params): 
        params.append(f"Detector='{attr.value}'")

    # Depending upon the attribute the value being added could be a range of values also.
    @walker.add_applier(a.AttrName)
    def _(wlk, attr, params)
        attrmin = attr.min.value
        attrmax = attr.max.value
        # appending the attribute depending upon how it should be used in the query
        params.append(f"Attrmin='{attrmin}'+AND+Attrmax='{attrmax}'")

case 2: It is not already there in `sunpy.net.attrs`, in this situation we have to introduce the attribute and a walker needs to be created.

Example on its implementation:   

.. code-block:: python
    
    class Attrname("Type of attribute: SimpleAttr, Range"):
    """
    Description of attribute
    """
    # Depending on the attribute, this would include methods to make it easy to use in the search query
    # for example in case of Product, we convert it to lower case for it to be used.
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value.lower()

    # After this a walker applier need to be added, which have been shown above
