****************************
``sunpy-soar`` Documentation
****************************

A sunpy Fido plugin for accessing data in the Solar Orbiter Archive (SOAR).

Installation
============

``sunpy-soar`` requires ``python >= 3.10`` and ``sunpy >= 5.0``.
Currently it can be installed from PyPI using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install sunpy-soar

or conda using

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge sunpy-soar

``sunpy-soar`` and the VSO
==========================

``sunpy-soar`` queries the official repository of Solar Orbiter data, the SOAR.
The Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) as of writing (September 2022) mirrors a subset of the Solar Orbiter archive alongside many other solar physics data sources.
The VSO allows data from multiple missions/observatories to be easily queried in one go, but users should be aware that the VSO is not the official repository for Solar Orbiter data and does not currently (as of September 2022) provide a comprehensive listing of all available Solar Orbiter data.
