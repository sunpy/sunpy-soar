Usage of Generative AI
----------------------

We expect authentic engagement in our community.
Be wary of posting output from Large Language Models or similar generative AI as comments on GitHub or any other platform, as such comments tend to be formulaic and low quality content.
If you use generative AI tools as an aid in developing code or documentation changes, ensure that you fully understand the proposed changes and can explain why they are the correct approach and an improvement to the current state.
